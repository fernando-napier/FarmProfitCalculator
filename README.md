# Farm Profit Calculator

This is a program that helps farmers to keep an account of different expenses and returns within an easy to use program. This program also comes with charts and graphs that detail how the user's data relates to averages within their region.

The goal of this app is to give information to farmers to allow them to make informed decisions when choosing what to spend money on in the hopes that lowering costs would help their bottom line. 

The next step of this project is to implement a section in which the user is given information regarding how yield and returns interact. A graphing library may probably need to be created with the intention of showing the correlation between yield and returns.

The amount of money that is poured into keeping yield high could be costing farmers higher profits. We are now at a point where a disproportionate amount of money is being spent to increase yield by a few percentage points and farmers are not receiving a proportionate return for spending that extra money.

For now, there is a bit of work to be done to complete the project, but the current application can act as an accounting application.
